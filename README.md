# StellarisModGrabber

Makes switching around mods for MP games easier.

## What it does it do?
It can grab your last activate mods, back up your current config, clear all active mods and override your current mod list with a new one. 

It will also check the mods you currently have downloaded(read: subscribed on the workshop) and tell you if you are missing one, or more, and provide a link to the missing mod. As of now it will tell you which file you are missing, it will look like this "mod/ugc_826432049.mod" (I have no idea how to read the modname from the workshop ID, if you know how let me know). 

## How does it do that?
Your last used mods are stored inside settings.txt located in \Documents\Paradox Interactive\Stellaris. All it does is manipulate the list of active mods inside


## Other Stuff
Is it perfect? No I do this as a hobby and its probably horribly inefficent and breaks the heart of actual programmers, but it works.

I will update it when I see a reason to.

I should also make a better documentation. Probably.
