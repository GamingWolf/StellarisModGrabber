# StellarisModGrabber

Makes switching around mods for MP games easier.

I created this program because I got tired of manually editing mods in and out and then not even having the right ones downloaded.
So I made this.
Is it perfect? No I do this as a hobby and its probably horribly inefficent and breaks the heart of actual programmers, but it works.

I will update it when I see reason to.

I will not invlude feature requests unless I really like the idea.
