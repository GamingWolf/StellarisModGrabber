## The Future
As long as I enjoy playing stellaris and writing code this project should always be in some kind of working order.
Please note that I am not a proffessional programmer and will make a lot of mistakes. These mistakes will probably create some nasty bugs, if you find one please create a new [Issue](https://github.com/GamingWolf/StellarisModGrabber/issues) and I will fix it as soon as I can.

I am wroking on making this mod manager work on all bigger paradox titles that i play (eu4, ck2 and stellaris).
